    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Online Voting System. Please read the following instructions carefully before you proceed:</p>
    
    <h4>1. Voter Registration</h4>
    <p>To participate in the voting process, you must first register as a voter. Provide your complete details including first name, last name, mobile number, email, username, password, and Aadhaar number. Once registered, you can log in to your account.</p>
    
    <h4>2. Voter Login</h4>
    <p>After registration, log in using your username or email and your password. If your credentials are correct, you will be redirected to your Voter Dashboard where your profile details and voting status are displayed.</p>
    
    <h4>3. Voter Dashboard</h4>
    <p>Your dashboard shows your personal details and indicates whether you have already voted. If you haven't voted yet, you can proceed to the Voting Page.</p>
    
    <h4>4. Voting Process</h4>
    <p>On the Voting Page, you will see a list of candidates fetched dynamically from the database. Select your preferred candidate and cast your vote. Once you vote, your status will be updated, preventing you from voting again.</p>
    
    <h4>5. Candidate Registration (Nominee Registration)</h4>
    <p>Candidates who wish to contest in the elections must register through the Candidate Registration page. They need to provide details such as their name, party, classification, experience, and upload their candidate symbol. These details will be displayed on the Nominee Page.</p>
    
    <h4>6. Nominee Display</h4>
    <p>The Nominee Page displays all the candidates along with additional information like party, classification, and experience. This helps voters make an informed decision before casting their vote.</p>
    
    <h4>7. Voting Restrictions</h4>
    <p>Each voter is allowed to cast only one vote. After your vote is recorded, your status is updated, and you cannot vote again.</p>
    
    <p>Thank you for using the Online Voting System. If you encounter any issues, please contact the system administrator.</p>
